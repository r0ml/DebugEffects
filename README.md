#  SwiftUI Shaders

- is there a way to redraw the snapshot when the parameters change?

- Use scrollPosition instead of ScrollReader

- figure out a way to stack effects (i.e. pre-view effects and post-view effects for the metal views)

- must divide the size of the passed layer image by 2 for debug to match swiftui

- implement selecting backgrounds from Photo Library

- implement taking snapshots and exporting to file or Photo Library

- implement recording shader video and exporting to file or Photo Library

- handle dropping movie onto the arg image well

=================================================================

- Mipmaps are not available in the images generated by SwiftUI

- Shaders can differ in debug mode if there are fixed pixel counts used in the shader,
   because the MetalView has twice the pixel dimensions of the SwiftUI view (related to the screen default scale)
