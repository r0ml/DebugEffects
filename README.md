#  SwiftUI Shaders

- is there a way to redraw the snapshot when the parameters change?

- First time the camera is authorized, it fails to appear.  Restarting the app makes it work.  Parameterized > MonochromeFade

- Use scrollPosition instead of ScrollReader

- Make UI to get Webcam in arguments

- figure out a way to stack effects (i.e. pre-view effects and post-view effects for the metal views)

- split filter93 into layer effects and distortion effects -- it is not an extra image argument.

- possibly changing the info property in layers can resolve the scaling issue in layer effects?  and use it for colore effects?

- resuming video flashes some other image before resuming (but not in debug mode) -- I think it is aspect ratio recalculation...

- single stepping doesn't work'

=================================================================

- Mipmaps are not available in the images generated by SwiftUI

- Shaders can differ in debug mode if there are fixed pixel counts used in the shader,
   because the MetalView has twice the pixel dimensions of the SwiftUI view (related to the screen default scale)
