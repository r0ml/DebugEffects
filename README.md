#  SwiftUI Shaders

- is there a way to redraw the snapshot when the parameters change?
- is there a way to have the snapshot animate when hovering over it?

- First time the camera is authorized, it fails to appear.  Restarting the app makes it work.  Parameterized > MonochromeFade

- moving away from a video shader, then back again, causes weird jerky update-once-a-second behavior.

- need to implement a way to pass the additional image to the view (as a parameter/option)

- Use scrollPosition instead of ScrollReader

** - Make UI to get images in arguments
** - Make UI to get background in arguments
- Make UI to get videos in arguments
- Make UI to get Webcam in arguments

- figure out a way to stack effects (i.e. pre-view effects and post-view effects for the metal views)

=================================================================

- Mipmaps are not available in the images generated by SwiftUI

- Shaders can differ in debug mode if there are fixed pixel counts used in the shader,
   because the MetalView has twice the pixel dimensions of the SwiftUI view (related to the screen default scale)
